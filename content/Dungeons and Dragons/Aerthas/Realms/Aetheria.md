#### **Geography**

Aetheria is a land where magic does not simply exist—it thrives, saturating every inch of the continent. **Arcane storms swirl across the skies, rivers shimmer with raw mana, and the very earth hums with unseen power.** It is a continent shaped not by time, but by sorcery, where reality bends and the impossible becomes commonplace.

The landscape is both breathtaking and unpredictable, shaped by centuries of magical influence:

- **The Arcane Spires** – Massive crystalline formations of pure mana jut from the earth, humming with latent energy. Some believe they were once conduits to other planes, others say they are the crystallized remains of an ancient spell that was never completed.
- **The Manaflood Plains** – A rolling expanse of **golden grasslands infused with magical energy**, where wild magic surges cause unpredictable effects. Here, a single spark can ignite an explosion of life—or destruction.
- **The Shimmering Expanse** – A great desert where the sand is not sand at all, but **glittering fragments of arcane glass**, remnants of a cataclysmic magical war. Time and space are **unreliable here**, and travelers may find themselves wandering into other realities.
- **The Eldertree Canopy** – A vast enchanted forest, where **trees grow as tall as mountains, their roots winding through the fabric of magic itself.** Some believe that within its depths lies the birthplace of the Elves.
- **The Riftlands** – A region where the fabric of reality is unstable, causing **gaps between the material world and other planes.** Strange creatures, lost souls, and whispers from forgotten dimensions can be encountered here.
- **The Silver Lakes** – Lakes that reflect not the sky, but **the future, the past, or visions of other worlds.** These waters are rumored to hold divine properties, and **some say even the gods peer into them to glimpse fate.**
- **The Obsidian Labyrinth** – A massive underground network of shifting tunnels and forgotten ruins, **home to rogue wizards, exiled warlocks, and creatures born from failed experiments.** The deeper one goes, the older and stranger the magic becomes.
- **The Celestial Veil** – A region where the sky itself seems close enough to touch, **shimmering with constellations that move and shift as if alive.** It is said that some stars here are not stars at all, but the lingering spirits of long-forgotten deities.
- **The Ethereal Cliffs** – A jagged coastline where the sea itself is infused with magic, creating waves of glowing water that sometimes reveal portals to unknown realms beneath their surface.

Aetheria is **not bound by the rules of the mundane world**—its magic is both a blessing and a curse, a land of wonder and peril in equal measure.
