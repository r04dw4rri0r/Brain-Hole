#### **Geography**

Elarion is a land of **ethereal beauty and ancient magic,** where the boundaries between the material world and the mystical Veil of Aeonara are thinner than anywhere else in Aerthas. Vast **enchanted forests**, **floating lights**, and **mystical rivers** define its landscape, with nature itself shaped by the will of the Elves and the lingering echoes of the Song of Creation.

The land is divided into distinct regions, each shaped by the Elves' influence and the deep magic that permeates the land:

- **The Sylvan Expanse** dominates the heart of Elarion—a colossal forest of towering silverwood trees and luminous flora that glows softly beneath the moonlight. Some trees are so massive that entire Elven cities rest in their boughs. The deeper one travels into the woods, the more time and reality itself seem to shift.
- **The Starborn Glades** stretch across the northern lands, a vast expanse of rolling hills, ancient meadows, and crystalline lakes that reflect the heavens. It is said that the first Elves emerged from the pools of starlight here, born from the dreams of Lirien.
- **The Umbravale** is a shadowy woodland in the west where the natural order frays, allowing the Feywild to bleed into reality. Time bends unpredictably, and **twisted paths lead to forgotten Elven kingdoms, lost in the folds of time and space.**
- **The Evervale** in the south is a land of **eternal autumn**, where golden-leaved trees stand against a sky that never shifts from the hues of dusk. This realm is closely tied to the Elven mystics, who guard **the last remnants of pre-Sundering magic.**
- **The Crystal Spires of Lirioneth** rise in the east, where the first Elven city still stands. These **impossibly high towers of enchanted glass** glow with inner light, humming with the resonance of Elarion’s first melodies. Some say the spires are not just buildings but living conduits of arcane power.

The land itself resists foreign invaders; thick mists roll over the forests to obscure paths, vines shift and entangle those with ill intent, and even the rivers change course seemingly at will. This is a continent where **magic and nature intertwine as one.**
