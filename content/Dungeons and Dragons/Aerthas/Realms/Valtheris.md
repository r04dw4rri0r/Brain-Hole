#### **Geography**

Valtheris is the **largest and most diverse** of the nine continents, a land of **towering mountains, rolling plains, ancient forests, and vast ruined cities** that whisper of past empires. It is a realm of **constant war, political intrigue, and lost civilizations**, where the ambitions of mortals clash upon the ruins of forgotten gods.

The continent is divided into distinct regions, each shaped by history and conflict:

- **The Emerald Highlands** – Rolling green hills and fertile farmland dominate the heartland of Valtheris. This region, dotted with castles and walled cities, has been the center of **countless human kingdoms** over the centuries. The land is beautiful, but its soil is stained with blood from endless wars.
- **The Ruins of Itharos** – In the east, shattered remnants of the once-great **Itharosian Empire** lie in decay. The cities, once marvels of magic and architecture, are now haunted by ghosts, rogue sorcerers, and strange aberrations born from the empire’s downfall.
- **The Ashen Wastes** – A scorched, blackened land where the **sky is forever tinged with gray**, the result of an ancient calamity that unleashed both fire and madness upon the land. Some say **it was the work of the Malikar**, others that it was a war between the gods.
- **The Frostspire Peaks** – A mountain range to the north, home to the **greatest Dwarven strongholds** outside of Kaz’dran. These mountains are rich in **mithril, adamantine, and ancient secrets buried deep beneath the stone.**
- **The Weeping Mire** – A cursed swamp where an empire **once stood**, now swallowed by a creeping, intelligent bog that **devours the souls of those who enter.** Twisted trees and half-sunken temples hint at the grandeur that once was.
- **The Golden Coast** – The western shoreline, filled with bustling trade cities, merchant republics, and naval fleets that constantly vie for dominance over sea routes. It is the heart of **commerce and political intrigue.**
- **The Obsidian Pass** – A great chasm in the land, splitting the continent in two. Some say **it was carved by a blade of a fallen god**, others claim it is an ancient wound from the Sundering. The pass is guarded by fortresses, for it is a vital strategic point in any war.
- **The Bloodfields** – A cursed battlefield where wars never truly end. Spectral warriors fight under a **perpetual red sky**, cursed to relive their deaths until someone can break the cycle.

Valtheris is a land **forged in conflict**, where the past shapes the present, and the ambitions of mortals echo louder than the voices of the gods.
