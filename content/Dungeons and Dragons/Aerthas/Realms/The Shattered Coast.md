#### **Geography**

The Shattered Coast is a land where the sea reigns supreme. **A vast continent dominated by rugged shorelines, dense jungle interiors, and towering sea cliffs, it is a land of both prosperity and peril.** The northern regions are marked by **rolling hills, fertile fields, and temperate forests, where merchant lords and naval powers thrive.** The central and western coasts feature **storm-wracked cliffs, hidden coves, and labyrinthine inlets**, where pirates and freebooters make their homes.

To the **south**, close to the equator, a **series of long, narrow peninsulas** stretch out into the sea like the fingers of a great hand. These land formations create **a treacherous, maze-like strait** where ships can be easily ambushed, making it both a boon for seafarers who know its hidden paths and a death trap for those who do not. This region, known as **The Maw**, is a **chokepoint for all trade moving between the great seas**, making it a fiercely contested area.

**The surrounding waters are notoriously unpredictable, with sudden squalls, thick fog banks, and powerful ocean currents that can pull ships off course.** Many islands dot the coastline, some home to fishing villages and trade hubs, others serving as pirate hideouts or the remnants of ancient civilizations swallowed by the waves.
