#### **Geography**

Drakora is a continent where the laws of nature and reality are fluid, shaped by the ever-changing influence of the Feywild. **Time flows unpredictably, the landscape shifts at the whims of unseen forces, and the very air is thick with enchantment.** What is a tranquil meadow one day may become a dense, luminescent jungle the next, as the magic of the Fey reshapes the world to suit its whims.

Drakora’s geography is as beautiful as it is treacherous:

- **The Blooming Wilds** – A vast, rolling landscape of **ever-changing flora**, where trees grow in impossible shapes and flowers bloom in colors never before seen. The plants are often sentient, some whispering secrets, others luring travelers into eternal slumber.
- **The Prismatic Glade** – A radiant expanse where the **light bends and dances, forming illusions so real they can be touched.** Here, mirages walk as if they were living things, and **memories can take physical form.**
- **The Twilight Thicket** – A vast forest bathed in eternal twilight, where **mushrooms the size of houses glow with an eerie bioluminescence.** The deeper one goes, the more time and space become uncertain, leading to realms beyond mortal comprehension.
- **The Crystalweave Highlands** – A mountain range where **jagged peaks of shimmering crystal** reflect not only light, but glimpses of other dimensions. Some peaks serve as gateways to the Seelie and Unseelie Courts.
- **The Dreaming Mire** – A **shimmering swamp where reality itself is liquid.** Pools of water reflect not what is above them, but **visions of forgotten histories, possible futures, or otherworldly creatures watching from beyond.** Those who step into the wrong pool may find themselves elsewhere… or elsewhen.
- **The Wildsong Plains** – A vast, open landscape where the **winds carry melodies with no known source.** The grass hums, the rivers sing, and the sky sometimes **forms words out of clouds, whispering riddles to those who listen.**
- **The Shattered Grove** – A forest caught between planes, where trees flicker **between different seasons with every passing moment.** The creatures here shift forms constantly, flickering between **animal, fey, and spirit.**
- **The Feybound Isles** – Off the coast of Drakora, these islands are **said to exist in multiple places at once,** appearing and disappearing with the tides of the Feywild.
- **The Heart of Wonder** – A **floating landmass in the center of Drakora**, pulsing with raw Fey energy. It is said that **this is where the Fey first stepped into the world, and where the magic of the continent is at its strongest.**

Drakora is a land of **whimsy and danger, where wonder and terror are often two sides of the same coin.** Reality is subjective, and **those who do not understand its nature risk being forever lost.**
