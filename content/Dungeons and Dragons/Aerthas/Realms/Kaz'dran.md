### The Forge of the World
#### **Geography**

Kaz'dran is a land **dominated by towering mountain ranges, vast subterranean networks, and deep, hidden valleys** where the Dwarves have built their unbreakable fortresses. This continent is known as **the heart of the earth itself**, a place where molten rivers flow beneath the surface, and the air is thick with the scent of iron, stone, and smoke.

The **Titan’s Spine Mountains** run through the center of the land, an unbroken range of **jagged peaks that scrape the sky and plunge deep into the world below.** These mountains hold the **great Dwarven kingdoms, ancient forges, and lost ruins of civilizations long past.**

To the **north**, the land is covered in **tundra and ice-choked caverns**, where the winters are merciless, and **frost-clad giants roam the frozen wastes.** Massive glaciers carve through the land, creating deep ravines and ice caves that hold secrets from an age before mortals.

To the **south**, the mountains give way to **arid highlands and volcanic fields** where **rivers of lava carve through blackened rock,** and the very air hums with heat. It is here that the **Great Anvils**, the legendary forges of Kaz'dran, burn with eternal flame, fueled by the lifeblood of the earth itself.

To the **west**, the land descends into **rocky plateaus and craggy valleys**, home to nomadic mountain clans, reclusive stonekin, and scattered human settlements that rely on the Dwarves’ trade and craftsmanship.

The **east** is riddled with **winding caverns and massive underground lakes**, where bioluminescent fungi light the darkness, and entire civilizations thrive far from the surface. These **Deeproads** stretch beneath the land like the veins of a titan, connecting Kaz'dran’s greatest halls and extending even beyond the continent’s shores.
