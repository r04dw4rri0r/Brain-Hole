#### **Geography**

Vaelheim is a land **locked in eternal winter,** where the sun is often a pale ghost behind swirling blizzards, and the nights are long and perilous. Located at the southernmost reaches of Aerthas, **it is a continent of ice-bound mountains, frozen seas, and tundras stretching endlessly beneath storm-laden skies.**

- **The Frostspire Range** – A titanic chain of **snow-covered peaks and jagged cliffs** that divide Vaelheim into eastern and western halves. Some of the highest mountains **pierce the heavens, where only the bravest (or most foolish) dare tread.**
- **The Everfrost Tundra** – A vast, windswept expanse of **snow, permafrost, and glacial rivers,** where the land itself seems to groan beneath the weight of the cold.
- **The Iceflow Ocean** – The northernmost sea, **covered in thick ice for most of the year.** Massive icebergs drift through its frozen waters, and sea serpents lurk beneath.
- **The Shattered Bay** – A **coastline of broken fjords and towering ice cliffs,** where ancient glaciers calve into the sea.
- **The Veil of Storms** – A permanent blizzard **wrapping around the heart of Vaelheim, said to be the breath of an ancient, sleeping god.** No one who enters unprepared returns.
- **The Frostwood Vale** – A rare **taiga forest**, where massive **evergreen trees stretch for miles, their trunks thick with ice and their canopies home to snow-white owlbears.**
- **The Howling Wastes** – An **uninhabitable, storm-wracked plain where the wind screams like a vengeful spirit.** It is said to be haunted by the souls of those who perished in the ice.
- **The Glacial Abyss** – A rift **so deep that no explorer has ever found its bottom.** Some believe it leads to another realm, while others whisper that something **watches from its depths.**
- **The Sunless Fjords** – A jagged network of **shadowed valleys where ancient ruins lie frozen in time.**
