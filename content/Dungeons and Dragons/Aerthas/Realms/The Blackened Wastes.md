#### **Geography**

The Blackened Wastes is a land **scarred by ancient calamities, cursed beyond redemption, and shrouded in an unholy darkness** that clings to its very bones. Once a thriving region, it was forever twisted by **the Sundering and the rise of the Malikar,** the ancient forces of destruction. **It is a realm of ashen plains, scorched deserts, and festering swamps, where life struggles against an ever-present decay.**

The very air here is **tainted with an oppressive aura,** thick with whispers of long-dead souls and the distant echoes of forgotten horrors. **Magic behaves erratically** in the Wastes, and many who enter find themselves **drained, corrupted, or lost to the madness** that festers in its darkest corners.

- **The Ashen Expanse** – A seemingly endless **wasteland of grey dust and shattered stone**, where the remains of once-great cities lay buried beneath the cinders of history.
- **The Dreadmire** – A toxic, churning swamp where **the ground is made of rotting corpses and bubbling tar.** The water here is thick with disease, and the air reeks of death.
- **The Weeping Chasm** – A **miles-long fissure that glows with an eerie crimson light.** Some say it is a wound in the world itself, where **the lifeblood of the earth was drained away.**
- **The Shattered Peaks** – Jagged, **obsidian mountains jutting from the wasteland like the broken teeth of a dead god.** Here, dark fortresses rise, their halls echoing with **whispers of forgotten horrors.**
- **The Veil of Night** – A region **so consumed by darkness that light itself struggles to exist.** Even the brightest flames **burn only as embers, and the sun is reduced to a mere smoldering glow.**
- **The Plains of Bone** – A vast **graveyard of titanic skeletons**, the remains of primordial beasts and forgotten warriors who fell during the Sundering. The bones still hum with dark magic.
- **The Rift of Souls** – A **storm-wracked void**, where spectral forms twist through the air, screaming in endless agony. Those who wander too close may **find their own soul being pulled into the abyss.**
- **The Forsaken Sanctum** – Once a place of worship, **now a blasphemous ruin where the echoes of lost gods can still be heard, crying out in torment.**

#### **Key Biomes**
