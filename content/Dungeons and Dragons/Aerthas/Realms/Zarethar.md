#### **Geography**

Zarethar is a land of **perpetual twilight, where the sun barely pierces the thick, unnatural gloom** that blankets the region. The land itself is jagged and treacherous—**twisting black mountains, vast dead forests, and choked swamplands make up the majority of its terrain.** Strange and unnatural fog rolls through the valleys, and even the rivers seem dark and sluggish, reflecting an eerie, moonlit glow even when no moon is visible in the sky.

At its heart lies the **Obsidian Rift, a massive scar upon the land where shadows seem to take physical form, writhing and whispering as if alive.** This rift is said to be a tear between the material plane and the Abyss, from which dark entities and nightmarish creatures emerge.

To the **west**, the land is **a barren, rocky wasteland** where jagged spires of obsidian rise from the cracked earth, and the very air crackles with malevolent energy. The ruins of ancient cities lie half-buried in blackened sand, their former inhabitants long consumed by the darkness.

To the **east**, vast **ashen plains and sickly forests stretch toward the borders of Valtheris and Elarion.** These lands are heavily contested by warring factions, each seeking to control the borderlands for their own dark purposes.

To the **south**, an endless **murky swamp known as the Mire of Souls** serves as both a natural barrier and a cursed land where the dead do not rest. Wraiths, ghouls, and worse creatures roam freely, drawn by the remnants of dark magic that saturate the waters.

The **north** is dominated by the **Dreadspire Peaks**, an imposing mountain range where ancient fortresses, now ruled by liches, vampire lords, and exiled necromancers, loom over the land like silent sentinels.

#### **Key Biomes**

- **The Obsidian Rift** – A nightmarish chasm of swirling darkness, rumored to be a gateway to the Abyss. The air here is thick with whispers and malevolent energy, corrupting any who linger too long.
- **The Forsaken Woods** – A vast, dead forest of petrified trees and hanging mist. Creatures made of shadow lurk between the branches, and travelers often vanish without a trace.
- **The Ashen Expanse** – A desolate, scorched plain covered in blackened soil and volcanic rock. Strange fires flicker in the distance, burning with no apparent fuel.
- **The Mire of Souls** – A festering, cursed swamp where the spirits of the damned rise from the waters, seeking vengeance on the living.

- **The Shadowborn** – A race of beings adapted to the twilight realm, with eyes that glow in the dark and an affinity for shadow magic. Some serve the Duskar Lords, while others resist them.
- **Cultists of the Abyss** – Fanatical worshippers of dark gods and abyssal entities who seek to widen the Obsidian Rift and unleash its horrors upon the world.
- **Undead Legions** – Massive armies of the dead march across the land, their numbers swelling as they claim the lives of all who oppose them. Skeleton warriors, wights, and revenants serve as shock troops, while banshees and death knights command them.
- **Demonspawn & Fiends** – Zarethar is home to countless abyssal horrors that emerge from the Rift, preying upon mortals and bending them to their will.

#### **Notable Locations**

- **Dreadhold Keep** – The seat of the Duskar Lords, an immense fortress-city that looms over the land, its towers perpetually shrouded in swirling black mist. It is both a capital and a prison, where political schemes, dark rituals, and blood-soaked wars shape the future of Zarethar.
- **The Black Spires** – A collection of towering obsidian obelisks that pulse with an eerie glow. Scholars believe they are remnants of an ancient empire that once ruled Zarethar before succumbing to darkness. Some claim they whisper secrets to those who listen.
- **The Riftborn Catacombs** – A massive underground labyrinth of crypts and tunnels, said to stretch beneath the entire continent. Many who enter never return, for the dead do not sleep here.
- **The Weeping City** – A ruined metropolis where the buildings seem to weep black ichor, and tormented spirits wail endlessly. It is said that something powerful and ancient slumbers beneath its streets.
- **The Shadowforge** – A cursed foundry where blacksmiths forge weapons of immense power, imbued with abyssal energies. The price of wielding such a weapon is often one’s own soul.
- **The Maw of Valtur** – A massive sinkhole that leads into the Abyss itself. Demonic creatures regularly crawl from its depths, and the very ground around it is corrupted beyond saving.
