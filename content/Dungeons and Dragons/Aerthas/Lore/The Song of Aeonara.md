# **The Birth of the Realms**

Before the first dawn, before the earth had form, there was only the Endless Void and the One Who Dreamed. This being, known as **[[Aeonara]],** was neither god nor mortal, but a force of infinite will. From her thoughts, she wove a song—a melody so vast and powerful that it **gave shape to existence itself.**

Her first notes summoned the twin forces of **Light and Shadow,** who took form as luminous **[[Oris]]** and brooding **[[Valtur]].** They danced through the void, their movements creating the first stars, their clashes birthing the firmament. But soon, the harmony of [[Aeonara]]’s song was threatened, for [[Oris]] sought to weave a world of **unyielding radiance,** while [[Valtur]] wished to shroud it in **endless night.**

Aeonara, seeing their discord, sang a new verse. From it arose the **[[Celestara]],** the Shining Ones, beings of divine essence who shaped the heavens, and the **[[Primor]],** mighty titans who sculpted the land and seas. Together, they forged the world of **[[Aerthas]],** a realm of balance where **light and shadow intertwined.**

Yet, the song was not yet complete. [[Aeonara]]’s voice called forth the **[[Elemental Lords]]—fire, earth, sea, sky, and wind—to breathe life into the land.** Rivers ran like silver veins, mountains rose like slumbering giants, and the winds carried the whispers of the divine. From the last and most sorrowful note of her melody came **mortal life—fragile yet filled with endless potential.**

## **The Birth of the Mortal Races**

The gods and titans, shaped by [[Aeonara]]’s will, **each sought to leave their mark on creation.** Thus, they crafted races that would embody their ideals, passions, and ambitions. Some were formed from the elements, others from celestial blessings or the dark whispers of rebellion.

### **[[Elves ]]– The Weavers of Magic and Memory**

The **[[Elves]]** were the **firstborn mortals**, shaped by **[[Lirien]], the [[Celestara]] of Grace and Wisdom**, before the Sundering shattered the world. With forms sculpted from moonlight and song, Elves were created to **reflect the beauty of the world itself**—their souls intertwined with the magic that courses through Aerthas.

With their long lifespans, [[Elves]] became **the keepers of history, lore, and art**, ensuring that nothing of beauty would ever be forgotten. Their cultures flourished in the enchanted forests of **[[Elarion]]**, where their great cities **merged with nature**, forming towers of living wood, crystalline spires, and flowing rivers of light.

But their longevity was both a gift and a curse. Many [[Elves]] struggle with the **weight of memory**, lingering in the past while the world changes around them. Others seek to **master the arcane**, bending reality itself to their will, believing that **only through understanding magic can they preserve what was lost in the Sundering**.

Even now, the echoes of the Sundering linger in their hearts, and some [[Elves]] still search for a way to **restore what was broken**.

### **[[Dwarves]] – The Keepers of the Forge**

Brought to life by **[[Thargrum]], the [[Primor]] of Stone and Flame**, **[[Dwarves]]** were shaped from the **mountains and fire** of the newborn world. They were **not merely born, but forged**, given **souls as unyielding as steel** and **hearts that burned with a love for creation**.

They built their **great citadels beneath the mountains**, carving **endless halls of stone and metal**, forging weapons and wonders that would outlast even the gods. [[Dwarves]] do not **merely endure**; they **thrive**, standing unbroken even when the world shifts around them.

Yet, their devotion to **craftsmanship and tradition** can lead to stubbornness. To a [[Dwarf]], a promise is as solid as the stone beneath their feet, and a grudge can last **centuries**. But to those who earn their trust, a [[Dwarf]] is the most steadfast ally one could ask for.

In war, they fight as **living bulwarks**, clad in armor of their own making, wielding weapons infused with the **flames of their ancestors**. Even in the face of the Sundering, the [[Dwarves]] endured, their deep halls standing **long after the world above was shattered**.

---
### **[[Humans]] – The Children of Change**

Forged in the wake of the Sundering, **[[Humans]]** were created by **[[Myndaros]], the [[Celestara]] of Change and Ambition**. Unlike the elder races, whose destinies were deeply tied to the nature of their creators, [[Myndaros]] granted humanity something unique—**the power of boundless potential**.

[[Humans]] were not given the long lives of [[Elves]], nor the craftsmanship of [[Dwarves]], nor the innate magic of the [[Dragonborn]]. Instead, they were given **the gift of ambition**, the ability to rise beyond their origins, to build, conquer, and adapt to any land they touched. They spread across Aerthas faster than any other race, shaping kingdoms, empires, and civilizations that would rise and fall like the turning of the seasons.

Where some sought **knowledge and enlightenment**, others sought **power and dominion**. The **greatest heroes and the most terrible tyrants** have all walked among humankind, for no other race has been so driven to **shape the world in their image**.

### **The [[Dragonborn]]: The Children of the Eternal Flame**

Amidst the chaos of the Sundering, **[[Aurikhal]]**, the **[[Primor]] of Dragons**, sought to restore balance. A being of colossal might, he was neither fully aligned with [[Oris]] nor [[Valtur]] but instead embodied the **unyielding force of will and fire**. From his own essence, he forged the **[[Dragonborn]]**, a race imbued with the strength and majesty of dragons.

Each [[Dragonborn]] bore the blood of a dragon’s lineage—gold and silver for those tied to order and wisdom, red and black for those drawn to conquest and ambition. Though not true dragons, they inherited the **legacy of their creator**, standing as warriors, sages, and guardians of ancient knowledge.

Many [[Dragonborn]] built their **empires upon the ruins of the old world**, believing themselves destined to reclaim the grandeur lost in the Sundering. Others, however, sought to walk among the other mortal races, forging alliances or challenging the supremacy of the elder civilizations.

### **[[Gnomes]] – The Dreamers of Invention**

Where [[Elves]] were made to **preserve beauty**, **[[Gnomes]]** were made to **create it**. Brought into being by **[[Zethelis]], the [[Celestara]] of Curiosity and Invention**, [[Gnomes]] were shaped from **starfire and wonder**, filled with an **unquenchable thirst for knowledge and discovery**.

Unlike the larger races, who sought **power and conquest**, [[Gnomes]] found joy in the **smallest of wonders**—the gears of a clockwork machine, the dance of light through a crystal, the secret melodies hidden in the rustling of leaves.

They built **cities of impossible design**, filled with spinning contraptions, flickering lights, and inventions that could either **change the world or explode spectacularly**. To a [[Gnome]], failure is merely a step toward success, and **each mistake is a lesson in disguise**.

Their lives may be short compared to [[Elves]], but they are **filled with endless creativity**, ensuring that **no day is ever wasted**.

### **[[Halflings]] – The Keepers of Hearth and Harmony**

Created by **[[Althea]], the [[Celestara]] of Hearth and Harvest**, **[[Halflings]]** were born from the **gentle light of dawn and the rich earth of Aerthas**. Unlike the larger races, who sought **glory and dominion**, Halflings found joy in **simple pleasures**—good food, warm fires, and the laughter of family.

Though often overlooked, Halflings **see the world in a way others do not**. They know that **greatness is not measured by conquest, but by the joy one brings to others**. Their villages, nestled among rolling hills and golden fields, are **places of peace and plenty**, where the troubles of the outside world seem to fade.

Yet, when danger threatens what they hold dear, [[Halflings]] **reveal a courage that defies their small stature**. They may not seek adventure, but when it finds them, they rise to meet it with **wit, resilience, and an unshakable heart**.

---

### **[[Aasimar]] – The Radiant Heralds**

Born from **[[Oris]]’s divine light**, **[[Aasima]]r** are mortals touched by **celestial power**, their souls infused with **radiance and destiny**. Whether born of human parents or emerging from divine intervention, [[Aasimar]] are **marked by an inner light**—a purpose they cannot ignore.

Many are **called to be champions of justice**, protectors of the weak, or healers in times of darkness. Yet, some struggle against their divine heritage, seeking **freedom from the expectations placed upon them**.

Regardless of their path, [[Aasimar]] are **beacons of hope and change**, their very existence a reminder that **even in the darkest of times, light endures**.

---

### **[[Goliaths]] – The Titans of the Peaks**

Shaped by **[[Thargrum]]**, **[[Goliaths]]** were sculpted from **mountain stone and thunder**, their **massive frames** standing as **living monuments to the power of the earth**. They believe that **strength and honor** define one’s worth, and in their high-altitude clans, **only the strong may lead**.

Yet, strength is not merely **brute force**—to a [[Goliath]], **strength of will, wisdom, and loyalty are just as important as strength of body**. They are **nomads of the peaks**, forever **testing themselves against the elements**, knowing that **to stagnate is to grow weak**.

---

### **[[Orcs]] – The Stormborn Warriors**

[[Orcs]] were shaped by **[[Valtur]]**, **born from war, lightning, and fury**. They were meant to be his **perfect warriors**, creatures of **unyielding strength and indomitable will**. But **Orcs were never meant to be mere servants**.

Though many followed their warlike nature, others **forged their own destinies**, rejecting the cycle of bloodshed. Some **built great warrior clans**, bound by honor rather than destruction, while others sought wisdom, proving that **strength is not measured by conquest alone**.

---

### **[[Tieflings]] – The Cursed and the Chosen**

Born from the **whispers of [[Valtur]]**, **[[Tieflings]]** are the **unwanted children of the abyss**, their **souls forever marked by infernal power**. Some are the **descendants of ancient pacts**, others are **mortals who carry the lingering stain of the Sundering**.

Yet, not all [[Tieflings]] are bound by their blood. Many **struggle against their darker heritage**, seeking redemption or a place in a world that fears them. Others **embrace their infernal gifts**, walking the line between mortal will and abyssal temptation.

In the end, a [[Tiefling]]’s **fate is their own to decide**.

## **The Sundering and the Silence of Aeonara**

As the ages passed, the harmony of Aeonara’s song began to falter. The struggle between light and shadow **grew into war,** shattering the land in an event known as **The Great Sundering.** Once a single landmass, Aerthas was torn apart, forming **nine realms,** each bearing the scars of divine conflict.

Seeing the devastation, **Aeonara wept,** and her tears became the **Veil,** a boundary that separated the mortal world from the realms of spirits, fey, and abyssal horrors. With her song now sung, she withdrew beyond the Veil, entrusting the world to the gods, spirits, and mortals who would shape its fate.

But legend whispers that **Aeonara still dreams.** When the harmony of the world falters, **echoes of her song can be heard—guiding the lost, mending the broken, and calling forth heroes in the world's darkest hours.**

Some believe that the **most gifted bards and seers** hear these echoes more clearly than others, weaving them into **songs and prophecies.** In the times of greatest strife, when war, calamity, or imbalance threatens the world, Aeonara’s song is said to **resound once more,** calling forth those who will restore the balance of existence.

---

## **Final Words**

The world of Aerthas is still **unfinished,** its song still being sung. Though the gods shaped mortals in their image, **fate remains unwritten.** Whether they follow the paths set by their creators or rebel against them, **each soul adds its own note to the melody of existence.**

**And so the story continues.**
