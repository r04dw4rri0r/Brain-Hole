**The Song of Aeonara: The Birth of the Realms**

Before the first dawn, before the earth had form, there was only the Endless Void and the One Who Dreamed. This being, known as Aeonara, was neither god nor mortal, but a force of infinite will. From her thoughts, she wove a song—a melody so vast and powerful that it gave shape to existence itself.

Her first notes summoned the twin forces of Light and Shadow, who took form as luminous Oris and brooding Valtur. They sang through the void, their balance creating the first stars, their discordance birthing the firmament. But soon, the harmony of Aeonara’s song was threatened, for Oris sought to weave a world of unyielding radiance, while Valtur wished to shroud it in endless night.

Aeonara, seeing their discord, sang a new verse. From it arose the Celestara, the Shining Ones, beings of divine essence who shaped the heavens, and the Primor, mighty titans who sculpted the land and seas. Together, they forged the world of Aerthas, a realm of balance where light and shadow intertwined.

Yet, the song was not yet complete. Aeonara’s voice called forth the Elemental Lords—flame, stone, sea, and storm—to breathe life into the land. Rivers ran like silver veins, mountains rose like slumbering giants, and the winds carried the whispers of the divine. From the last and most sorrowful note of her melody came mortal life—fragile yet filled with endless potential.

Among the firstborn of mortal life were the Elves, crafted by Lirien, the Celestara of Grace and Wisdom. Lirien, hearing the echoes of Aeonara’s melody, sought to create beings who could weave the world’s magic into art, song, and knowledge. The Elves became stewards of the ancient forests, scholars of the arcane, and keepers of the first stories of the world.

The Dwarves were born from the forge-sparks of Thargrum, the Primor of Stone and Flame. With hands of iron and hearts of unyielding will, he shaped them from the bedrock of the world’s first mountains. He gave them mastery over metal and stone, crafting their souls with a love for creation and resilience. The Dwarves became the keepers of deep halls, builders of mighty fortresses, and the crafters of weapons and wonders.

Humans, however, were shaped by Myndaros, the Celestara of Change and Ambition. Unlike the other races, who were bound closely to the essence of their creators, Myndaros wove humanity with an uncertain thread—one that allowed them to adapt, dream, and defy the limits set before them. They were given neither immortality nor inherent mastery, but instead the endless drive to explore, build, and shape the world anew with each passing age.

But as light flourished, so too did shadow. Valtur, bitter from his endless struggle with Oris, sang a discordant verse of his own, giving rise to the Malikar, the First Betrayers. Twisting fragments of Aeonara’s melody, he created beings of hunger, cruelty, and ambition—demons, fiends, and the first dark lords who would sow strife across Aerthas. From his whispers, mortal hearts learned of envy, greed, and conquest, and thus the seeds of evil were sown.

Seeing the beauty of creation, Aeonara wept, and her tears became the Veil, a boundary that separated the mortal world from the realms of spirit, fey, and abyssal chaos. With her song now sung, she withdrew beyond the Veil, entrusting the world to the gods, spirits, and mortals who would shape its fate.

But legend whispers that Aeonara still dreams, and when the harmony of the world falters, echoes of her song can be heard—guiding the lost, mending the broken, and reminding all that creation is never truly complete. These echoes manifest as divine visions, mysterious melodies heard only by those in dire need, or celestial energies that momentarily restore what was thought lost. Some say that the most gifted bards and seers hear these echoes more clearly than others, weaving them into songs and prophecies. In the darkest of times, when war, calamity, or imbalance threatens the world, Aeonara’s song is said to resound once more, calling forth heroes to restore the sacred harmony of existence.
