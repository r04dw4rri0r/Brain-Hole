# The Age of Harmony
## **1A 1 – The First Dawn**

^a62c1b

The world was **newly formed**, shaped by the **[[Celestara]] and [[Primor]]**, with mountains, rivers, and forests spreading across the land. **[[Oris]] and [[Valtur]]**, once locked in a dance of balance, began to shape their own realms—**[[Oris]] pouring light into the heavens and [[Valtur]] weaving the first shadows into the deep places of the world**.

It was in this dawn that **[[Lirien]], the [[Celestara]] of Grace and Wisdom**, brought forth the **[[Elves]]**, weaving them from the **essence of magic and song**, making them the first mortals to tread the land. They awoke beneath the **canopy of the World Tree, [[Yggoril]]**, a colossal tree said to be rooted in the very fabric of creation.

For a time, the [[Elves]] alone shaped the world, exploring its **vast, unbroken lands**. They wandered the forests, built **small settlements**, and communed with the natural energies that pulsed beneath the surface of [[Aerthas]].

## **1A 100 – The Birth of the Dwarves**

^e94d7c

While the [[Elves]] flourished beneath the open sky, **[[Thargrum]], the [[Primor]] of Forge and War**, saw the need for beings of **strength and resilience**—souls who would shape the world from beneath rather than above.

From the **heart of the mountains**, he **forged the [[Dwarves]]** in the heat of the earth, sculpting them **from stone and fire**. He gave them **sturdy forms, endurance unmatched, and a love for crafting and battle**. Unlike the **[[Elves]], who were born to sing with magic**, the [[Dwarves]] were created to **mold the raw elements of the world into something greater**.

When the [[Dwarves]] **emerged from their mountain halls**, they looked upon the land not with wonder but **determination**—to build, to craft, to **leave their mark upon the world.**

## **1A 180 – The Age of First Cities**

^98d2bb

As the **[[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]** spread across the land, they began to **build civilizations**.

The **[[Elves]]**, having mastered the **arcane and the arts**, built their **first great cities**—wondrous places of **crystal towers, flowing rivers, and enchanted groves**. Their greatest city, **[[Vaelyndo]]r**, was raised beneath the **boughs of [[Yggoril]]**, becoming the seat of **[[Elven]] wisdom and magic**.

Meanwhile, the **[[Dwarves]]** carved their **fortresses deep into the mountains of [[Kaz'dran]]**, shaping the first **great underground halls**. The mightiest of these was **[[Kharzadur]], the Ever-Forged**, a city built into the heart of a volcano, where **molten rivers fueled the greatest forges**.

The **[[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]** acknowledged one another’s presence but remained largely **separate**, each following their **own path of mastery**—one of **magic**, the other of **craftsmanship**.

However, this separation would not last forever.

## **1A 546 - The First War of the Emerald Boughs**

The informal peace between the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] **fractured**, as **Dwarven mining expeditions dug too deeply into the roots of the forests**, unknowingly threatening the balance of magic. **Elven rangers and druids clashed with Dwarven engineers and warriors**, leading to a century of **conflict in the deep woods of Elarion**.

This war, called the **First War of the Emerald Boughs**, would continue for many centuries, with the [[Dwarves]] mining efforts continued to destabilize the [[Elves]] balance of magic. This destabilization would continue to threaten the world

## **Year 800 - The Rise of the First Magisters**

With peace restored, the Elves **delved deeper into the mysteries of magic**, seeking to master the **weave of creation** itself. The first **Magisters** emerged—Elven scholars who could **bend the arcane to their will**. They built **towers of learning and power**, forming the **Arcane Order**, a group dedicated to **understanding the nature of magic and the divine**.

Their experiments **unraveled hidden truths**, and some whispered that the **World Tree was more than just a tree—it was a bridge between realms, its roots touching all of existence**.

The Dwarves, meanwhile, **perfected metallurgy**, creating the first **mithril and adamantine weapons**, their forges burning with **sacred flame**. They crafted **legendary artifacts**, some of which would be **wielded by kings and warriors for ages to come**.

## **Year 1,200 - The Awakening of the Shadow Lords**

As Elves and Dwarves **flourished**, **Valtur, the Lord of Shadows**, brooded in the dark places of the world. He saw the **Elves’ light and the Dwarves’ fire** and despised their **dominion over the land**.

In secret, he wove his own **children from darkness and hatred**—**the Malikar, the First Betrayers**. These beings, infused with **Valtur’s abyssal power**, spread across **the world in secrecy**, corrupting and twisting **mortal hearts**.

Among them were the **Duskar Lords**, powerful warlocks who **sought dominion over life and death**. They formed the **first cults of the Abyss**, practicing **dark magics that defied the natural order**.

## **Year 1,500 - The Wars of Twilight**

The Duskar Lords, now growing in **number and power**, launched **the first great war of darkness**—the **Wars of Twilight**. Their armies of **twisted beasts, shadowspawn, and Malikar thralls** spread across the land, **threatening to consume all.**

For the first time, the **Elves and Dwarves** **united** against a **common enemy**. The great **Battle of Duskfall** saw the combined might of **Elven spellcasters and Dwarven warriors** drive back the **forces of the Abyss**, forcing the **Duskar Lords into hiding**.

Though they had won, the **war left scars upon the land**, and the **shadow had taken root in the hearts of many**.

## **Year 1,900 - The Growing Schism of Oris and Valtur**

The ancient struggle between **Oris, the Celestara of Light, and Valtur, the Lord of Shadows**, had remained a celestial battle **since the dawn of creation**. But as their influence spread into the mortal world, their **disagreements deepened**.

Oris saw the **mortal realm as a place of beauty and harmony**, a reflection of **the heavens**, while Valtur saw it as **a proving ground** where only the **strongest should rule**.

Their battles grew more **frequent and violent**, and their struggle soon reached the **roots of the World Tree, Yggoril**.

---

## **Year 2,000 - The Sundering**

The final battle between **Oris and Valtur** reached **its breaking point** when, in an act of **fury and defiance**, **Valtur struck at the heart of the World Tree**. His dark magic **corrupted its roots**, and Oris, in a desperate attempt to **purge the corruption**, unleashed **a divine fire** upon the tree.

The battle shattered **Yggoril**, and with it, the **land of Aerthas itself fractured into nine continents**.

Mountains crumbled, seas **rushed into the sundered land**, and entire civilizations were **lost beneath the waves or buried in the earth**. This event, known as **The Sundering**, marked the **end of the First Age** and the beginning of a new era.

As the world **reeled from the destruction**, new life **emerged from the chaos**—**humans, gnomes, halflings, and orcs** all arose in the **aftermath**, shaping the future of Aerthas.
