### **Origins of the Conflict**

By 1A 526, the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] had firmly established themselves as the dominant races of [[Aerthas]]. The **[[Elves]]** held dominion over the **vast enchanted forests** that stretched across **[[Elarion]]** and beyond, while the **[[Dwarves]]** had built **grand halls of stone beneath the mountains of [[Kaz'dran]]**.

For centuries, the two races coexisted in an uneasy peace, their interactions limited to wary trade and rare diplomatic meetings. But tensions were brewing beneath the surface.

The [[Dwarves]], ever the master craftsmen, **coveted the ancient heartwood of the [[Elven]] forests**, particularly the **[[Emerald Boughs]]**—a sacred stretch of towering trees whose **wood held latent magical properties**. The roots of these trees **drew upon the leylines of [[Aerthas]]**, making their timber **imbued with arcane energy**, highly sought after for crafting weapons, armor, and runes of immense power.

The [[Elves]], however, viewed the **[[Emerald Boughs]] as sacred**, believing that the trees were planted by **[[Lirien]] herself**, their souls intertwined with the natural magic of the land. Cutting them down was an **offense akin to sacrilege**.

What began as **small incursions**—[[Dwarven]] loggers venturing too deep, [[Elves|Elven]] rangers sending them back with warnings—soon escalated into **skirmishes**. The Dwarves, seeing the **immense value of the wood**, refused to relent. The Elves, seeing their sacred groves **desecrated**, retaliated.

By 1A 548, the war had begun.

### **Early Battles: The [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] Advance (1A 548 - 1A 559)**

The [[Dwarves]], believing in the superiority of their **arms and tactics**, launched a **bold offensive**, marching into the [[Emerald Boughs]] with **legions of iron-clad warriors**. They brought with them **runes of fire**, enchanted axes, and the might of **war machines**, believing they could simply **clear a path and hold the land**.

Their **first major victories** were swift. The [[Dwarves]], skilled in **siegecraft and ground warfare**, constructed **fortified encampments** along the edges of the [[Emerald Boughs]], cutting deep into the forest and erecting **watchtowers of black iron and stone**.

For **eleven years**, they pushed deeper, claiming **vast swathes of woodland**. The [[Elves]], though powerful in magic, were **unprepared for the sheer force of the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] war machine**. Their cities, built **for beauty and magic rather than war**, suffered under the **relentless [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] onslaught**.

But the [[Dwarves]] had made a **critical miscalculation**—they had **underestimated the patience and cunning of the [[Elves]]**.

### **The [[Elves|Elven]] Counteroffensive (1A 559 - 1A 588)**

The [[Elves]], realizing that **direct engagement against [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] steel and siege engines** was unwise, **shifted their tactics**. They abandoned **static defenses**, instead retreating into the depths of the forest, where the [[Dwarves|Dwarves’]] heavy armor and rigid formations became a hindrance.

For the next three decades, the [[Elves]] waged a **relentless guerrilla war**, turning the very **landscape into a weapon**.

- **[[Elves|Elven]] archers** struck from the trees, raining arrows **enchanted to pierce armor**.
- **Illusory magics** led entire [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] battalions **astray**, causing them to march in circles or stumble into **deadly traps**.
- The **forest itself began to fight back**—[[Elves|Elven]] druids awakened the trees, causing roots to **ensnare soldiers** and vines to **strangle war machines**.
- **[[Dwarves|Dwarven]] supply lines were sabotaged**, their outposts burned, their morale slowly crumbling.

By **1A 588**, the [[Dwarves]] found themselves **overstretched and outmaneuvered**. Their numbers **dwindled**, their mighty war machines **lay abandoned**, rusting in the depths of the forest. Their once-strong offensive **collapsed into a desperate struggle to hold what little land they had taken**.

### **The Fall of [[Kharvaz-Thol]] (1A 588 - 1A 615)**

The turning point came in **1A 588**, when the [[Elves]] launched a **massive assault** on **[[Kharvaz-Thol]]**, the [[Dwarves|Dwarves']] primary stronghold in the [[Emerald Boughs]].

The fortress had been built with **thick walls and deep tunnels**, a bastion that the [[Dwarves]] believed to be **impenetrable**. But the Elves **did not lay siege by traditional means**.

Instead, they **called upon the magic of the land itself**.

- **[[Elves|Elven]] mages sang spells that turned stone to dust**, weakening the walls from within.
- **Druids commanded the roots to burrow deep**, cracking the very foundation of the keep.
- **Illusions and enchantments** caused **infighting among the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] ranks**, as warriors struck at **phantoms and false shadows**.
- **[[Elves|Elven]] saboteurs infiltrated the stronghold**, poisoning wells and setting **vast sections of the underground city ablaze**.

By **1A 615**, [[Kharvaz-Thol]] fell. Its **once-proud halls collapsed**, its forges silenced, its banners **cast into the flames**. The last [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] hold in the [[Emerald Boughs]] was lost.

### **The Treaty of [[Vaelyndor]] (1A 616)**

^456424

With their armies **broken** and their war effort **in ruins**, the [[Dwarves]] had no choice but to **surrender**.

In **1A 616**, the surviving [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] lords were summoned to **[[Vaelyndor]]**, the [[Elves|Elven]] capital, to sign **a treaty that would forever be remembered as a mark of shame**.

The Treaty of [[Vaelyndor]] **heavily favored the [[Elves]]**:

1. **The [[Dwarves]] were forbidden from ever setting foot in the [[Emerald Boughs]] again.**
2. **Any trade of [[Emerald Heartwood]] was outlawed**, with the [[Elves]] maintaining absolute control over the resource.
3. **[[Dwarves]] were required to pay tribute** in the form of gold and crafted goods to the [[Elves]] for the next **two centuries**.
4. **The destruction of the forests caused by the war had to be repaired**, with the [[Dwarves]] forced to contribute **stone and labor** to rebuilding [[Elves|Elven]] cities.
5. **The ruins of [[Kharvaz-Thol]] were to remain untouched**, a monument to [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] defeat.

This treaty was **bitterly resented** by the [[Dwarves]]. To them, it was **a humiliation**, a constant reminder of their **greatest failure**. Though peace was restored, **the wounds of war festered**, and tensions between [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] remained **for millennia to come**.

The First War of the Emerald Boughs ended with **[[Elves|Elven]] supremacy over the forests preserved**, but at the cost of **permanently souring relations between the two races**.

Even as centuries passed, the [[Dwarves]] **never forgot**.
