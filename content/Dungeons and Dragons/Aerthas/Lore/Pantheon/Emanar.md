### **The Emanar – The Celestara’s Lesser Aspects**

The **Celestara**, as divine beings of pure essence, are bound to the **Ethereal Veil** and cannot directly interfere with the **Material Plane** of Aerthas. To enact their will upon the world, they each created lesser divine beings known as the **Emanar**—celestial aspects imbued with a fraction of their creators’ power.

The Emanar exist in both the **Ethereal Realm** and the **Material Plane**, allowing them to serve as intermediaries, enforcers, and guides for mortals. While immensely powerful, they are not true gods and can be **destroyed or banished** through great effort. Each Celestara has their own unique Emanar, shaped in their image and imbued with their domains.
