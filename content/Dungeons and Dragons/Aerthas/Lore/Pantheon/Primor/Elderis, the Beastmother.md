## Primor of Beasts and the Wilds

Among the mighty Primors shaped by Aeonara’s song, there was one whose domain was neither stone nor sea, neither sky nor fire, but the breath of life that moved through the world. Her name was **Elderis, the Beastmother**, and from her boundless heart, all beasts, great and small, came into being.

#### **The Creation of Beasts**

Born from Aeonara’s song to fill Aerthas with untamed life, Elderis, the **Beastmother**, is the eternal force of nature’s wild and unrelenting will. She is the mother of all fauna, from the tiniest insects burrowing beneath the earth to the great beasts that roam the lands, soar through the skies, and lurk in the depths of the oceans. The howl of the wolf, the silent glide of an owl through the night, and the rumbling growl of a bear in the darkened forest are echoes of her presence.

Elderis, longing to see the world thrive, knelt upon the fertile earth and breathed deeply. With each breath, she exhaled life into the land. The first creatures to emerge were the smallest—mice, hares, and songbirds, filling the world with the first true sounds of nature. Then came the swift and the sly—foxes darting through the brush, wolves prowling beneath the moon, great cats stalking through the tall grass.

From the great mountains of Kaz’dran, she shaped the hardy goats and rams, their hooves finding purchase in the most treacherous heights. From the flowing rivers and crashing waves, she called forth fish, whales, and the mighty leviathans of the deep. She filled the air with creatures both wondrous and terrifying—falcons that soared, owls that hunted in silence, and dragons, her greatest creation, born of the untamed storms and the fury of the elements themselves.

But Elderis did not stop at mere animals—she is also responsible for the creation of the **beast races**, those who walk the line between civilization and the wild. The **Aarakocra** soar upon the winds, their connection to the skies a gift from Elderis herself. **Bugbears** embody the lurking predators of the forests, powerful and silent hunters. **Centaurs** blend the strength and speed of beasts with the intellect of mortals, running wild across the plains. The **Tabaxi**, quick and cunning, are the very essence of feline grace and agility. Many others, from the **Minotaurs** to the **Lizardfolk**, owe their existence to her design, each carrying the instincts and prowess of the creatures they resemble.

Thus, the wilds came to life, no longer an empty canvas but a world teeming with creatures that would forever walk, crawl, swim, and soar through the lands of Aerthas.

#### **Domain and Influence**

Elderis holds dominion over all natural life that is not bound to the mortal mind. While the Celestara and their Emanar watch over the mortal races, Elderis watches over the beasts of the world. She has no great halls or temples, nor does she demand worship—her domain is the untamed wilds, the sacred balance of predator and prey. Druids, shamans, and those who revere nature pay homage to her, but she does not answer prayers with words, only with signs—an unexpected rain after drought, a sudden migration, the resurgence of a near-extinct species.

Her influence is strongest in the deep places of the world—the untouched forests of Elarion, the endless plains of Valtheris, the primal jungles of Aetheria. Even in the cold wastes of Vaelheim, her creatures endure, fur-clad and fierce against the bitter storms. Wherever the wild things roam, Elderis is present, ensuring that the balance of nature remains intact.

#### **The Wild Pact – The Law of Balance**

Unlike many Primors, Elderis does not seek dominion, temples, or worship in the traditional sense. Instead, she enforces the **Wild Pact**, an unspoken yet binding law that ensures the natural world remains in balance. Predators and prey must remain in equilibrium, and those who take from the land must also give back. Those who slaughter recklessly, defile the wilds, or seek to bend nature to their will without regard for its harmony will find themselves at the mercy of the Beastmother’s wrath.

Her punishments are as vast and unpredictable as nature itself—an individual might be hunted by relentless beasts, a kingdom could find itself plagued by famine and storms, or an entire civilization may be swallowed by the unyielding advance of the wilderness. Yet, those who live in harmony with nature often find themselves favored, gaining strength from the beasts they respect and wisdom from the wilds they embrace.

#### **Appearance and Manifestations**

Elderis rarely takes form, but when she does, she appears as a colossal, shifting entity—a fusion of the creatures she has birthed. She may have the noble antlers of a stag, the piercing eyes of a wolf, the wings of an eagle, or the coiled might of a serpent. Her voice is the whisper of the trees, the distant call of a hunting hawk, the growl in the night. Those who seek her guidance often do so in dreams, where she appears as a great beast of ever-changing form, leading them through endless forests and wild landscapes.

To those who revere nature, she is a guardian and a guide. To those who seek to defile it, she is a terror lurking just beyond the firelight.

#### **Legacy**

Though Elderis does not involve herself in mortal affairs as other Primors might, her influence is undeniable. Druids, shamans, and rangers revere her not as a goddess, but as the embodiment of the untamed world they serve. The beast races she created hold an innate connection to her will, whether they acknowledge it or not. Even the great predators of Aerthas, from the dire wolves of Vaelheim to the jungle leviathans of Aetheria, move in accordance with her unseen hand.

To Elderis, the world of Aerthas is not a kingdom to rule—it is a living, breathing thing, wild and free. And she will see to it that it remains that way.
