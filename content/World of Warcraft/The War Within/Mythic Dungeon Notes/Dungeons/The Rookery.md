### Lead up to second boss
- Mobs
	- Diffuser
		- Attracting Shadows: pulsing AOE dmg while you get sucked into an AOE death zone, just move against the suck.

	- Civilian
		- nothing of note

### Second Boss: Stormguard Gorren
- Chaotic Corruption: targets random player and places a DOT, if DOT is dispelled or expires it jumps to closes person. the trick is when DOT is dispelled or expires, you always want to pass it to someone new as it will leave a vulnerability debuff that causes the player to take addtl dmg from the DOT. basically its hot potato, just dont repeat victims.
- Crush Reality: targets random party member w/ a massive AOE circle. when it lands, boss will leave a black puddle on ground AND summon black cyclones, dodge cyclones and get out of AOE circle.
- Dark Gravity: tires to suck party to middle of the room while doing light party wide AOE, do not get sucked into the zone.

	- Ascendant
		- **==Void Bolt: single target magic nuke==**
		- Feasting Void: does AOE dmg to everyone + heal absorb
		- Umbral Wave: spawns 4 orbs on its hitbox, find safe spot from the orbs so you can dodge. there are 2 waves so you need to adjust position after the first wave goes out.
	- Crusher
		- melees place a stacking debuff on tank, when stacks are high use mitigation, can kite + CC to drop stacks
		- Void Crush: targets random player and leaps on them, doing dmg to target and anyone within a 4 yard range
	- Civilian
		- nothing of note
	- Voidstone
		- Void Extraction: extracts void energy from mobs and players near by, causing mob to get a stacking dmg buff but other mobs and players get a dmg debuff

### Third Boss: Voidstone Monstrosity
- Healer should stay in the middle platform to make sure they can heal all the party members on the other platforms.
- Oblivion Wave: tank buster + frontal on tank, never point towards allies and use defensives
- Unstable Corruption: targets 2 random party members w/ a magical DOT, can be dispelled however when dispelled it drops a puddle
- Null Upheaval: does massive AOE party wide dmg, make sure party is topped up before cast goes out, swirlies get spawned so just avoid swirlies. 4 crystals get spawned near the boss and all non tank players get a debuff called Stormrider's Charge that gets a blue swirlies. when debuff drops, Stormriders will charge the player that clears the crystals so you want to run towards crystals when you get debuff. if you dont clear a crystal it will spawn an add that does pulsing AOE dmg, you need to focus the add down to help the healer.
- Void Shell: throughout the fight the boss will place an dmg absorb shield on itself, you need to punch through the shell so the boss will gain a dmg amp debuff, some DPS should use CDs to punch through shell and other DPS should use their CDs once shell is down.
